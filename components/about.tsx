            I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication at [University Name], where I direct the
            <span className="font-semibold"> Research Lab</span>. My research examines the social and emotional
            implications of digital technologies, particularly how technologies impact well-being and social
            relationships. Through mixed methods, I study how people use technologies such as social media and AI
            chatbots to seek social support and cope with stress and loneliness.

          <p>
            My work is largely interdisciplinary, drawing on theories and methods from communication, psychology, and
            human-computer interaction. I collaborate closely with clinical scientists, computer scientists, and
            designers to better understand human behavior and address complex societal challenges. My research aims to
            generate insights that inform the design of socio-technical systems that foster more empowering, ethical,
            and beneficial human-technology interactions.
          </p>

            awards, including the <span className="font-semibold">Google Research Scholar Award</span> and the
            <span className="font-semibold">International Communication Association (ICA) Best Paper Award</span>.
